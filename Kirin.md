Kirin is an Elder Dragon in Monster Hunter World (MHW).

Kirin are so rarely sighted that little is known of their ecology. Kirin's power comes from her horn, and when her horn is broken she loses an immense amount of power.

It's been said they envelop themselves in pure electricity when they are provoked.
